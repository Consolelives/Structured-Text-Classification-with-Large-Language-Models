Scrum-half Williams rejoins Bath Bath have signed their former scrum-half Andy Williams on a short-term deal from the Neath-Swansea Ospreys. Wales international Williams, whose contract with the Welsh region was due to expire in June, has agreed a contract until the end of the season. With Martyn Wood's injury likely to keep him out until February, Bath need experienced back-up to Nick Walshe. Said Williams: "When this opportunity presented itself, I did not really have to think twice about it." Williams, capped by Wales against Romania in 2003, should figure in the match squad for Monday's Zurich Premiership match at Sale Sharks. He lost his Ospreys starting place to New Zealander Jason Spice and has fallen further behind in the pecking order. The Welsh region has two outstanding young No 9 prospects in Richie Rees and Rhodri Wells. Bath director of rugby Jack Rowell, though, believes Williams fits the bill perfectly. "He has been playing regular Heineken Cup and Celtic League rugby and he has a great affection for Bath," Rowell told Bath's official website. "We are delighted to be able to welcome him back to the club."
